                <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
                <p>I am Gregory Garzon a self-taught Full-stack web developer. I grew up on the computer as it was
                    my perferred way to play video games. I started my professional career in telecommunications, I joined
                    the local electrical union (IBEW Local 26) under the telecommunication side. I graduated 3 years later with
                    all the certificates achieved. Not soon after I realized that i was not learning anything new and begun to
                    become disinterested in work all together. In 2016 I started my journey of becoming a web developer, first by going to code academy
                    then later i discovered freeCodeCamp. One learning resource leads to another, then I knew that in this line of work you would never stop learning and that you could never learn 
                    it all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than a developer, I love video games, movies, tv series, pretty much everything that entertains me.
                    I follow various esports and love sci-fi movies and tv series.
